# HIV_Risk_Prediction_Model
HIV_Risk_Prediction_Model:

Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict and classify HIV treatment coverage risk levels (Low, Medium, High) using key features like ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) coverage rates and population statistics. This project involved:

Data Integration: Merged multiple datasets on HIV statistics, ART coverage, and prevention measures.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, extracting numeric insights from complex textual fields and handling missing values.
Model Development: Trained a Random Forest Classifier to identify risk categories with high accuracy.
Feature Importance Analysis: Visualized the influence of key features on model predictions for interpretability.
Deployment: Saved the trained model using joblib for future use and integration into other applications.
This project highlights skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model deployment while addressing a significant public health issue.
